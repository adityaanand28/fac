                What you have asked is a billion-dollar question, and honestly saying, there is no accurate answer to this.
                <br>See, in technical analysis, we rely totally on the past data patterns, and we assume the patterns have their due probabilities of repeating themselves. If you are familiar with Machine Learning, you know the concept of training and test data, which is nothing but data extracted from history. We may put weights to the parameter in the model, but we cannot make a new dataset which is much different from the model.
                <br>Fundamental analysis is a different game altogether. In this, we don't assume that the historical pattern will repeat itself; instead, we first try to develop core concepts that govern the behaviors and mechanisms. Take, for example, MDA. If the corporate structure is corrupted, the company will eventually have to close its books. In this, we do not solely depend on the historical share price or even fundamental ratios of the company; instead, we dig deep into the links behind the questions, why the share price or profitability ratios are going down? We tried to fundamentally establish some causality between the quantitative metrics and the governing principles and fundamentals.
                <br>Hence, fundamental analysis involves much subjectivity but assures us with a more reliable and stable result. However, there's still a problem. This "subjectivity" is nothing but a perspective of an individual or an equity research firm, and hence prone to biases based on the incentives or human error. Technical analysis can also result in biased results if the data or model is not a representation of the population.
                <br>To some extent, we can pat ourselves in dealing with the uncertainties. One good example of this is, Monte-Carlo simulations - we predict outcomes in a variety of scenarios (using ML) and keep some capital cushion for the uncertainties that have been predicted. However, a business cannot keep aside all the capital as the cushion. Therefore the cushion capital is proportionate to their probabilities as predicted by the model.
                <br>To add a disclaimer, one of the underlying grave assumptions that we took is - the inflation and GDP will remain constant till perpetuity. Inflation and GDP are an outcome of the macroeconomic factors, which in turn is controlled by the strategic decisions taken by the monetary and fiscal policies from time to time.
                <br>Biased result (fundamental or technical) < Unbiased technical analysis < Unbiased fundamental analysis (long term) < Unbiased (fundamental + technical) analysis
                <br>The last one (above) is the best we can achieve. However, there could still be events (like COVID 19), which are called Black Swan (kindly Google). These events cannot be predicted (even if we consider the outliers) and are capable of tremendously eroding the profits and, ultimately, the whole capital.
                <br>To sum up, we all are just experiencing and then learning to adjust to the uncertainties.

                <br>UFCF (2017) = EBIT (2017) - Taxes (2017) + Depreciation (2017) - NWC (2017) + CapEx(2017)
                <br>or, in a generalized way,
                <br>UFCF (2017) = EBIT (2017) -/+ Taxes (2017) +/- Depreciation (2017) -/+ NWC (2017) -/+ CapEx(2017)
                <br>All of them are correct in their own sense.
                <br>The solution lies in the visualization. How you are treating each of the items. Take, for example, Rs 2k has been deducted from the account, now I can say, + 2k as the outflow or -2k as inflow. Sometimes, people write, -2k as outflow, but thanks to the intuition, we eventually get things right.
                <br>The same idea revolves around calculating the cashflow. Try to assume that you own this company, so you better know the inflows and outflows. Generally, +ve is taken as inflow and -ve as outflow.
                <br>To arrive at the UFCF, you need to add all the cash inflows. Now, inflow can further be +ve or -ve, same as the Rs 2k example. If PPE (2017) is 100 and PPE (2016) was 80. Therefore, the company made Rs 20 + 10 (depreciation), in fixed assets in (2017).
                <br>In the FCF and UFCF table, you can mention CapEx as +30 or -30, it is up to you, no issues, at least at the foundation level.
                <br>Case 1, if you are writing CapEx (2017) as +30:
                <br>UCFC (2017) = EBIT (2017) + ... - (+ 30) (CapEx 2017)
                <br>Case 2, if you are writing CapEx (2017) as -30:
                <br>UCFC (2017) = EBIT (2017) + ... + (- 30) (CapEx 2017)
                <br>Sometimes, this gets confusing. To make this simple, try to visualize from the angle of the cashflow, and remember the tag (inflow or outflow) you have assigned to each of the line items. In the end, make adjustments from the rationale that you have established.
