          <h2 id="what-is-valuation"><strong>What is valuation?</strong></h2>
<p>When I say the word valuation most of you think about models and numbers and you&rsquo;re right there are lots of models and lots of numbers but behind every evaluation is a <strong>story</strong> about the company describing it&rsquo;s future backed by financials so that we are not swayed away by our emotions in our fantasy world</p>
<p>If you want to earn great returns you have to focus on 2 things :</p>
<ol>
<li>The company should have a good business model i.e Qualitative research - How it earns revenue and its management</li>
<li>Its fair value so that we don’t overspend</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-most-of-the-valuations-around-us-are-wrong"><strong>Why most of the valuations around us are wrong?</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bias</strong> you have due to preconceptions from all the news we hear</li>
<li><strong>uncertainty</strong> as we try to predict future</li>
<li><strong>complexity</strong> we live in a complex world with complex data and complex models these models become black boxes after a while it&rsquo;s not clear who&rsquo;s running whom?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-valuation"><strong>Why Valuation?</strong></h2>
<p>It gives you a <strong>lifeline</strong> as it keeps in check your emotional mind from taking absurd decisions by backing our decisions with <strong>real</strong> data.</p>
<p>Which factors you should keep in mind while evaluating a business?</p>
<p>E.g - Say you own a burger stall</p>
<ol>
<li>What&rsquo;s your revenue? you sell 100 burgers a day at Rs 50. Your revenue = 50*100 =5000/day</li>
<li>What are your expenses? your cost of managing a burger stall is 2500/day including your stall and employee expenses</li>
<li>What is the nature of expenses? Are they fixed costs or they depend on customers? A fixed cost would include your stall and its maintenance.</li>
<li>What are your future growth possibilities and your market audience? Your audience will be mostly young people and if you are good enough you may open another stall</li>
<li>What is your Competitive Advantage? What is that what makes your burger stall unique from every other burger stall?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2-methods-of-valuation"><strong>2 methods of valuation:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discounted cash flow</strong> the value of an asset is the present value of the expected cash flows</li>
<li><strong>Relative valuation</strong> to value an asset and relative valuation you look at what similar assets are being priced at by the market right now and once you find them you use that as your basis for valuing this asset</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assumption"><strong>Assumption</strong></h2>
<p>if markets <strong>never</strong> made mistakes there would be no point to value in publicly traded companies right the market price of the company would be the best estimate of the value of the company so every one of these approaches assumes market mistakes and how those mistakes get corrected.</p>
<h2 id="cash-flow-valuation-or-intrinsic-valuation--"><strong>Cash flow valuation or intrinsic valuation</strong> -</h2>
<p>cash flows-future value of the company you see a discount rate that reflects the risk in those cash flow you are <strong>assuming</strong> that markets make mistakes and valuing individual companies and that they correct these mistakes over time markets can make mistakes you can find those mistakes but there is no guarantee that those mistakes will get corrected in the next three months or six months or even a year the longer time horizon the better</p>
<p>U may ask why are we <strong>estimating cash flows</strong>? you book a profit of 1crore its quite possible you may not get 1crore due to some defaults by buyers</p>
<p>What is <strong>free cash flow</strong> ? as most of the businesses need some money for future years for their functioning when you remove that money which is essential for your business to run from cash flow you get free cash flow</p>
<p><strong>Present value</strong>? if I ask you you have 2options you can take rs1000 today or 1005next year what would you choose – probably you would choose 1st as even in govt bonds we could get 6% return and make it 1060 which is larger we do the same thing in stocks we compare the price we pay today with the future value which the stock might bring and then calculate its worth in present time</p>
<p><strong>DCF</strong> is the reverse of compound interest if I would give you 1060 next year what should you pay me this year? Well the answer should depend on the trust you have in me (risk involved) intrinsic valuation the value of the business is a function of its expected cash flows growth and risk intrinsic value is designed for cash flow generating assets so if you gave me a business stock, a young growth company a start-up I can use intrinsic valuation when can I not use it give me a Picasso to value I couldn&rsquo;t give you the intrinsic value of a Picasso because it could entirely be in the eyes of the beholder value of an asset is the present value of the expected cash flows discounted back at a risk-adjusted discount rate</p>
<p><strong>Growth</strong> - the amount we reinvest in the business* the return on the capital company is making</p>
<p><strong>Discount rate</strong> -I can value either the equity in the business or I can value the entire business all I care about are the equity investors I look at the cash flows that the equity investors get out of the business those are the cash flows left over after I&rsquo;ve made my interest payments my principle payments all the payments due to the bank cash flows to equity our cash flows that equity investors can take out of the business if those are the cash flows I&rsquo;m focusing on the discount rate I should be using is the rate of return that equity investors would need to make given the risk of that equity you could try to value the entire business you&rsquo;re a business owner you tend to think about the cash flows equity as your cash flows I&rsquo;m asking you to expand your vision look at the collective cash flows you get out of the business that cash flow is called a cash flow to the firm and if that is the cash flow you&rsquo;re discounting the discount rate you&rsquo;re going to use is a weighted average of what equity investors demand which is the cost of equity and what lenders demand which is a cost of debt</p>
<p><strong>Relative valuation</strong>: you value an asset based on how similar assets are priced you&rsquo;ve given up an intrinsic valuation when you do relative valuation so I don&rsquo;t know what the intrinsic value is I&rsquo;m going to the market tell me and if you might not be able to compare the values of individual companies because some are smaller some are larger but if you divide that value by earnings or Book value for relative valuation is you need to find other investments that look just like yours that might be easy in some cases it&rsquo;s difficult when you look when you&rsquo;re talking about companies find me a company that&rsquo;s similar to Microsoft which is quite difficult you need to control for differences across these investments growth and risk and cash flows you assume that markets are right on average but that they&rsquo;re wrong in individual companies and that they&rsquo;re wrong in individual companies that those mistakes will get corrected sooner rather than later.</p>
