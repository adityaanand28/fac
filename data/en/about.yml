    The Finance and Analytics Club, IIT Kanpur is one of the largest professional clubs on campus, hosting a full schedule of events to help everyone from those with no background in finance to those coming from finance looking to switch focus within the industry.

    It is a community of finance fanatics consisting of highly dedicated coordinators (juniors) and secretaries (sophomores) working under them. The team comprises of students from different majors brought together by their interest in finance.

    We believe that an investment in learning pays the best interest and that one’s degree should never become an impediment in their way to pursue the things they are passionate about. So, we organize various events, workshops and quizzes for the campus community curious about finance and analytics.

    Apart from this, we offer a multitude of projects that touch upon different aspects. We believe this would promote a holistic development of our own as well as other interested students’ knowledge of finance.

    We also try to keep everyone updated with what is going on in the corporate world by posting business and finance related articles regularly on our Facebook handle.
