    content: "\"Know what you own and why you own it\" - Peter Lynch\nFinance is an
      inseparable part of everyone's life.We noticed that opportunities in the field
      of  finance were very limited. We noticed fewer  corporates visiting our campus
      for finance roles compared to other IITs. So I pitched the idea of a focused
      club/hobby group to Simrat. A club which shall serve a dual purpose - grooming
      the talent pool for finance-related opportunities and increasing financial literacy
      of the  campus junta. It was our final year with placements close but we decided
      to give it a try. We took the idea to Senate .Finally, after much  deliberations,
      we got a green signal.We planned and worked rigorously. The response that we
      received  from the campus junta was overwhelming. Post the placement season,
      our focus shifted towards \nimproving financial literacy. We offered students
      to be a part of a semester-long boot camp and  ensured that performing students
      were given  adequate credentials/certificates which would help them in the future
      internship/placement process. We tried to give our best to the campus junta
      . And so the club's legacy continues The club gives you a great head start to
      build a career in finance. Overall, the learning experience was great !!\n"

    content: I started with FDG in the second year of its existence when I met Anish
      and Simrat(Founders) and I was asked to lead the group.   With the vision to
      help more students in not only decoding the financial industry but also help
      them in preparing for finance roles, I started my journey. We organised topic
      specific lectures, competitons in Takneek, winter projects camp where we mentored
      students on topics like Derivative Pricing Models, Portfolio Optimization etc,
      case study event in Techkriti and a trading/investing course in Partnership
      with a professional platform. It was an amazing learning experience for me.
      Being a management student, I didn't had much interactions with SnT Council
      but to be honest, everyone was extremely supportive. I am sure the club is going
      to touch greater heights in the years to come.

    content: As I joined IITK, I was amazed by the overwhelming variety of student
      activities on campus but it took me some time to realize there was still scope
      for improvement. Being from an Economics background, a proclivity towards finance
      was natural, and not much to my surprise Finance Discussion Group existed on
      campus. My first interaction with the Hobby Group was through an innovative
      certificate-based lecture series. My tenure started at an irregular time and,
      I wanted to convert the group to a club with much-more reach on campus. We started
      increasing the reach through sessions, workshops, newsletters, projects, and
      whatnot. At the end of my tenure both at IITK and hobby-group, we managed to
      organize a Non-Core Weekend with eminent personalities as speakers. Finally
      with the help of Gensec and my fellow-coordinators we were able to convert the
      FDG hobby-group into Finance and Analytics Club (FAC). This whole duration taught
      me a lot more than just finance, public-speaking, managing events. I owe a lot
      to the club itself, but it is still a lot more to go. This experience impacted
      and changed my personality for good.
